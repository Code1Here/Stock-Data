# Stock Trading Data

This is my first python app & it is a web scraping applicatoin collecting useful data on stocks from the Yahoo Finance domain. 
I find value in metrics such as: 
+ Forward P/E
+ Price-to-Sales
+ PEG Ratio
+ Volume
+ Average Volume
+ Short % of float
+ Profit Margin
+ Operating Margin
+ Return of Assets
+ Return on Equity
+ Quarterly Revenue Growth
+ Gross Profit
+ Total Cash
+ Total Debt
+ Total Debt/Equity
+ Current Ratio
+ Operating Cash Flow

What this application acheives thus far **12/18/2022** is to:
1. Calculate the volume percentage change above or below the average volume on any given day
2. Print the earnings date, which traders use to bet on a security's price direction
